    If checked, this option indicates that authentication and user/group membership lookups
    which fail due to communication errors (e.g., LDAP server is unreachable, manager password is
    incorrect) will be reattempted using the next configuration. Other types of failures, such as
    a user attempting to authenticate with an incorrect password, will not be reattempted.
    </p>
    <p>
    If unchecked (the default), authentication and user/group membership lookups which fail due to
    communication errors will not be reattempted using the next configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
    The default is intended to prevent users or groups with the same name in distinct LDAP domains
    from being inadvertently mapped to the same user or group in Jenkins if one of the domains is
    unavailable. Consequently, this option should only be enabled if all configured domains have
    distinct user and group names.
